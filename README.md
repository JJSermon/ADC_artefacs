# ADC_artefacs
Artefacts caused by aliasing of common downsampling and delta sigma analogue to digital converters. Plotting and checking tools

base indicates common downsampling ADC
delsig indicates delta sigma ADC

_manySRplot indicates plotting of artefacts across a large range of sampling rates
_specSR indicates the ability to choose a specific sampling rate, which will indicate if artefacts is created at this frequency combination or not

Input and Output labels are found in functions
